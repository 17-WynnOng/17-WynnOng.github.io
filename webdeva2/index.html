                    Ando was convicted of tax evasion in 1948 and served two years in jail. In his biography, Ando said
                    he had provided scholarships for students, which at the time was a form of tax evasion. After he
                    lost his company due to a chain-reaction bankruptcy, Ando founded what was to become Nissin in
                    Ikeda, Osaka, Japan, starting off as a small family-run company producing salt.

                <p>
                    With Japan still suffering from a shortage of food in the post-war era, the Ministry of Health tried
                    to
                    encourage people to eat bread made from wheat flour that was supplied by the United States. Ando
                    wondered why bread was recommended instead of noodles, which were more familiar to the Japanese. The
                    Ministry's response was that noodle companies were too small and unstable to satisfy supply needs,
                    so
                    Ando decided to develop the production of noodles by himself. The experience convinced him that
                    "Peace
                    will come to the world when the people have enough to eat."
